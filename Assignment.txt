Give me some idea on what is a Datatype in JavaScript ? What are Primitive Data types and non-primitive data types ? Explain with some examples.


A:- Data type in JavaScript.

A data type in JavaScript represents the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated in a program. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold different data types at different times during execution.

Data types in JavaScript are categorized into two main types:
1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

---

1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after being assigned (though the variable can be reassigned). They are stored directly in the stack.

Types of Primitive Data Types:
1. String
   Represents textual data.  
   Example:
   
   let name = "Alice";
   console.log(name); // Output: Alice
 

2. Number
   Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.  
   Example:
   
   let age = 25;
   let temperature = 98.6;
   console.log(age, temperature); // Output: 25 98.6
 

3. Boolean
   Represents true or false values.  
   Example:
   
   let Active = true;
   console.log(Active); // Output: true
 

4. Undefined
   Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.  
   Example:
   
   let x;
   console.log(x); // Output: undefined
 

5. Null
   Represents an intentional absence of value.  
   Example:
   
   let y = null;
   console.log(y); // Output: null
 

6. Symbol (introduced in ES6)
   Represents a unique identifier.  
   Example:
   
   let sym1 = Symbol("unique");
   let sym2 = Symbol("unique");
   console.log(sym1 === sym2); // Output: false
 

7. BigInt (introduced in ES11)
   Represents integers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.  
   Example:
   
   let bigNum = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
   console.log(bigNum); // Output: 123456789012345678901234567890n
 
   -2^53-1 to +2^53-1  bigInt range

2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

Non-primitive data types are mutable and are stored in the heap memory. The variable holds a reference to the memory location, not the actual data.

Types of Non-Primitive Data Types:
1. Object
   A collection of key-value pairs.  
   Example:
   
   let person = {
       name: "Bob",
       age: 30,
   };
   console.log(person.name); // Output: Bob
 

2. Array
   Represents an ordered list of values.  
   Example:
   
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
 

3. Function
   Represents a block of code that can be executed.  
   Example:
   
   function greet() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   }
   greet(); // Output: Hello!
 

4. Date, Map, Set,
   Built-in objects in JavaScript for specific purposes.  
   Example:
   
   let date = new Date();
   console.log(date); // Output: Current date and time

Comparison of Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

Primitive:
   Stored in Stack
   immutable
   directly holds the value
   let x = 10;

Non Primitive:
   Stored in Heap
   Mutable data types
   Holds the reference to the value
   let obj = { a: 1 };
   

Example Illustrations

Primitive Example:

let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // Output: 10 (value is copied, not affected by changes to `b`)


Non-Primitive Example:

let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1.name); // Output: Bob (both refer to the same object in memory)
